# Time 2
## It's a whole new type of time...Time 2 - (It's metricized mostly)
#
### Here's the deal:
Years are divided into 10 months, each ending in ...ber, beginning with the correct prefix or some approximation of it, and using a, e, i, o, u, a, e, i, o, u because it was just too good of an opportunity to pass up (Premamber, Duember, Trimber, Quadomber, Pentumber, Sextamber, September, Octimber, Nonomber, Decumber). It also switchex to the holocene calendar for year numbers (adding 10,000 years) because it might as well. 
# 
Each year has 36 weeks and 5 bonus days for a total of 365 days. These bonus days come at the beginning of the year (not reflected in the python program) and are not part of any month, which means the days of the week always line up to be the same every year and each month always has 36 days or 3.6 weeks. 
#
Each week has 10 days named after the planets, sun, and moon. They are: Neptday, Saturday, Uraday, Jupiday, Earday, Marday, Venday, Merday, Sunday, and Monday (in english, ideally the break/work day order is break, work, work, work, break, break work, work work, break). 
#
Each day is divided into 10 hours, each lasting 100 minutes, which in turn have 100 seconds apiece. This comes out to about 0.9 seconds in Time 1 per second in Time 2. This makes a work day about 3 hours long (in time2). 
#
The earth has 20 time zones separated by 50 minutes apiece. The dividers are roughly equidistant, with obligatory changes like state and country lines and the entirety of China. Daylight Savings no longer exists. 
#
Also Premaber 1 is the Winter Solstice (Dec. 21 in time1, this is not compatible with the python program because I haven't changed it to make the bonus days come at the beginning of the year but I might do it later).
#
Here are the bonus days: New Year's Day, Generic Religious Feast Day + Secular Feast Day (for those who are not religious), Earth Appreciation Day, En Memorium Day, Appreciation of Parents and Also People Who Aren't Parents but Believe They Should Also be Appreciated Day, and BONUS Day (leap day).
